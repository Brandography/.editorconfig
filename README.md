# [Brandography](https://www.brandography.com) Editor Config
An editor config allows us to set standard syntax rules for our whole team, regardless of the editor they are using.

- Install Editor Config for your Editor: http://editorconfig.org/
- Download the .editorconfig file in this repository to your home directory

Certain projects may also have a local `.editorconfig` file which overrides the root.

To install the `.editorconfig` file in your home directory, run this command: `curl https://raw.github.com/Brandography/.editorconfig/master/.editorconfig > ~/.editorconfig`
